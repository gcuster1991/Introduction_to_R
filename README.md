# Introduction to R repository 

Hi, I see you've found you way to the “Introduction to R” repository. Whether you’re here for yourself or for your students, I'm glad that you are. In this repository you will find all the necessary materials for implementing the tutorial. Our tutorial is a general, non-sub-discipline specific implementation that starts with the absolute basics of R and Rstudio. One of the benefits of this tutorial is that it is easily customizable to your field of study. If you would like to work on making a tutorial that is specific to your field, please create an issue. If you are not familiar with Git, you can always email me at gordon.custer91[at]gmail.com. 

Good news! Our manuscript "Student perceptions towards introductory lessons in R" has been published in Natural Sciences Education. You can find the article under the following DOI: 10.1002/nse2.20073.
