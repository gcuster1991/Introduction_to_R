# Introduction to R repository 

Hi, I see you've found you way to the “Introduction to R” repository. Whether you’re here for yourself or for your students, I'm glad you are. In this repository you will find all the necessary materials for implementing the tutorial. The tutorial included is a general, non-sub-discipline specific tutorial that starts with the absolute basics of R and Rstudio. One of the benefits of this tutorial is that it is very easily customizable to your field of study. If you would like to work on making a tutorial that is specific to your field, please create an issue, or submit a pull request. If you are not familiar with Git, you can always email me at gordon.custer91[at]gmail.com. 

Good news! Our manuscript examining student perceptions towards R before and after the tutorial has been accepted at Natural Sciences Education. More to come!
